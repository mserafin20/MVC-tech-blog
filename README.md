  ## Description
  For this project we were tasked with building a mock blog website that allows the user to create, read, update, and delete blogposts. This website also implements a signup/signin, any user that wishes to create or update a post needs to have an account and be logged in.

  This website is a work-in-progress and not all functionalities will be working or available.
